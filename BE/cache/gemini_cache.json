It signals to the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, about the body's energy stores, suppressing appetite and increasing energy expenditure when fat stores are sufficient. While insulin is involved in fat storage by promoting the conversion of excess glucose into fat and can influence hunger, its primary role is blood sugar regulation. Melatonin and serotonin can influence appetite and metabolism, but they are not the primary regulators of both hunger and fat storage in the way leptin is.",

According to various sources, this minimum distance is typically specified as 8 to 12 feet (approximately 2.4 to 3.6 meters). Since this required separation is significantly greater than one meter, the statement that there must be a distance of one meter between two pits is factually correct, as the actual required distance will always exceed this value. The other options are incorrect: multiple pits are often required, negating the idea that one is always enough; a specific 3-meter distance from a junction box is not a standard requirement; and a separate gas pipe is not a standard component of a leach pit, although the septic tank itself is vented.",

Stating \"No thanks\" is a polite but firm refusal, and providing a reason like \"I care about my health\" reinforces the decision without being preachy. Health education strongly supports giving a reason for refusal, such as wanting to stay healthy or not wanting to get addicted.\n*   The friend's statement, \"Just one puff won't harm you,\" is incorrect. The toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke reach the brain, heart, and other organs within seconds of the first puff. Immediate effects can include irritation of the mouth and throat, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, and a reduction in the amount of oxygen carried in the blood.\n*   The other options are poor choices. Option A (Try it to stay friends) and Option B (Take it and pretend to smoke) both represent succumbing to peer pressure.

    "raw": "Answer: C\nConfidence: 10\nReasoning: Using a BEE 5-star rated air conditioner is the most effective way to reduce electricity bills among the given options. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **A. Running AC at 16°C:** Setting the air conditioner to a very low temperature like 16°C forces the compressor to work much harder and for longer periods, leading to significantly higher electricity consumption. Studies show that for every degree you raise the temperature, you can save on energy consumption. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) recommends setting the AC temperature at 24°C for optimal energy savings.\n\n*   **B. Keeping AC on all day:** Running the air conditioner continuously, especially when no one is home, is a major cause of high electricity bills. It's more energy-efficient to use a programmable thermostat to cool the house only when needed.\n\n*   **C. Using a BEE 5-star AC:** The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in India provides star ratings to appliances based on their energy efficiency. A 5-star rating indicates the highest level of energy efficiency, meaning the appliance consumes the least amount of electricity for the same level of performance. Upgrading to a 5-star AC can lead to significant savings on electricity bills over the long term.\n\n*   **D. Using an old AC:** Older air conditioners are generally much less energy-efficient than newer models due to outdated technology and wear and tear. They consume more electricity to provide the same amount of cooling, resulting in higher bills.",

A 5-star AC consumes significantly less electricity to provide the same amount of cooling compared to lower-rated models.\n\n2.  **Maintaining 24°C:** The BEE recommends 24°C as the ideal temperature for balancing comfort and energy efficiency in India. Setting the thermostat higher reduces the energy consumption of the air conditioner, as the compressor does not have to work as hard or as long. Every degree increase in the AC's temperature setting can save about 6% on energy consumption.\n\nSince most electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels, a reduction in electricity consumption directly leads to a reduction in associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Therefore, by using highly efficient ACs at an optimal temperature, the office building reduced its overall energy use and, consequently, its carbon footprint.",
    "reasoning": "The environmental benefit is a direct result of two factors: the use of BEE 5-star rated air conditioners and maintaining the temperature at 24°C.",

Trains that arrived at their destinations with deceased passengers were grimly referred to as \"ghost trains\" or \"blood trains.\"\n\nOf the options provided:\n*   The **Shatabdi Express** and **Rajdhani Express** were introduced much later, in 1988 and 1969 respectively, and therefore could not have been used during the 1947 partition.\n*   The **Punjab Mail** and the **Frontier Mail** were both prominent, long-distance trains that were operational during the partition. Both of their routes, which originally ran into areas that became Pakistan, were significantly impacted.\n\nHowever, the **Frontier Mail**, which ran from Bombay to Peshawar on the North-West Frontier, is arguably the most fitting answer. It was one of the most famous trains in the British Empire at the time. After the partition, its route was shortened to Amritsar, the last major station before the new border with Pakistan, directly linking its service to the division of the country. Given its fame and the direct relevance of its name and route to the newly established frontier, it has become strongly associated with the partition era.",

The use of similar materials:** Contemporary Indian artists frequently use traditional textile materials. For instance, celebrated sculptor Mrinalini Mukherjee was known for her use of jute and hemp fibre, and artist Gurjeet Singh uses scrap fabrics for his soft sculptures. Other artists work with materials like cotton, natural dyes, and various fibres.\n\n*   **B. The adoption of weaving techniques in other media:** Artists have incorporated textile techniques such as weaving, stitching, and embroidery into their work. Monika Correa, for example, learned to operate a loom to create intricate tapestries, experimenting with the weaving process itself.\n\n*   **C. The representation of textile patterns and designs:** Traditional Indian textile patterns, including floral motifs, paisley (known as *buta* or *boteh*), and geometric designs, are widely represented in modern art and design. Artists and designers incorporate these enduring patterns into various forms, from paintings to contemporary fashion.\n\nSince there is clear evidence for the use of textile materials, the adoption of weaving techniques, and the representation of patterns, the most accurate answer is that textile traditions have influenced modern Indian art through all of the above.",

The famine occurred while the Muslim League was in power in Bengal, and the crisis was heavily politicized. The Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu nationalist party, accused the Muslim League government of mismanaging the famine relief, favoring Muslim traders, and using the distribution of food as a tool for religious conversion. These accusations portrayed the Muslim League as incompetent and biased, thereby arguing against the viability of a future Pakistan.\n\nConversely, there were also narratives suggesting that Hindu traders and political leaders were hoarding food supplies to undermine the Muslim-led government. The famine exacerbated pre-existing economic tensions, where Hindu landlords and moneylenders often held power over a largely Muslim peasantry. This volatile mix of hunger, political maneuvering, and religious identity created a toxic atmosphere of blame and mistrust, which widened the communal chasm and contributed to the political polarization that culminated in the partition. Other famines and droughts listed, such as those in Tamil Nadu and Bihar, occurred much earlier and are not cited as having a comparable impact on the communal tensions of the pre-partition era.",

Its smooth, lustrous quality is often featured in religious and ceremonial garments.\n*   **The roughness of khadi:** Khadi, a hand-spun and handwoven fabric, is a powerful symbol of India's independence movement, self-reliance, and national pride. Its texture can vary, but it is often associated with a certain rustic roughness.\n*   **The layered quality of embroidery:** India has a rich and diverse tradition of embroidery, with various techniques creating intricate, layered textures. Contemporary artists continue to explore and reinterpret these traditional embroidery techniques in their work.\n\nGiven that modern artists can and do draw from this rich textile heritage, it is entirely possible for different artworks to intentionally evoke the distinct textural qualities of any of these materials.
