It signals to the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, about the body's energy stores, suppressing appetite and increasing energy expenditure when fat stores are sufficient. While insulin is involved in fat storage by promoting the conversion of excess glucose into fat and can influence hunger, its primary role is blood sugar regulation. Melatonin and serotonin can influence appetite and metabolism, but they are not the primary regulators of both hunger and fat storage in the way leptin is.",

According to various sources, this minimum distance is typically specified as 8 to 12 feet (approximately 2.4 to 3.6 meters). Since this required separation is significantly greater than one meter, the statement that there must be a distance of one meter between two pits is factually correct, as the actual required distance will always exceed this value. The other options are incorrect: multiple pits are often required, negating the idea that one is always enough; a specific 3-meter distance from a junction box is not a standard requirement; and a separate gas pipe is not a standard component of a leach pit, although the septic tank itself is vented.",

Stating \"No thanks\" is a polite but firm refusal, and providing a reason like \"I care about my health\" reinforces the decision without being preachy. Health education strongly supports giving a reason for refusal, such as wanting to stay healthy or not wanting to get addicted.\n*   The friend's statement, \"Just one puff won't harm you,\" is incorrect. The toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke reach the brain, heart, and other organs within seconds of the first puff. Immediate effects can include irritation of the mouth and throat, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, and a reduction in the amount of oxygen carried in the blood.\n*   The other options are poor choices. Option A (Try it to stay friends) and Option B (Take it and pretend to smoke) both represent succumbing to peer pressure.

    "raw": "Answer: C\nConfidence: 10\nReasoning: Using a BEE 5-star rated air conditioner is the most effective way to reduce electricity bills among the given options. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **A. Running AC at 16°C:** Setting the air conditioner to a very low temperature like 16°C forces the compressor to work much harder and for longer periods, leading to significantly higher electricity consumption. Studies show that for every degree you raise the temperature, you can save on energy consumption. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) recommends setting the AC temperature at 24°C for optimal energy savings.\n\n*   **B. Keeping AC on all day:** Running the air conditioner continuously, especially when no one is home, is a major cause of high electricity bills. It's more energy-efficient to use a programmable thermostat to cool the house only when needed.\n\n*   **C. Using a BEE 5-star AC:** The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in India provides star ratings to appliances based on their energy efficiency. A 5-star rating indicates the highest level of energy efficiency, meaning the appliance consumes the least amount of electricity for the same level of performance. Upgrading to a 5-star AC can lead to significant savings on electricity bills over the long term.\n\n*   **D. Using an old AC:** Older air conditioners are generally much less energy-efficient than newer models due to outdated technology and wear and tear. They consume more electricity to provide the same amount of cooling, resulting in higher bills.",

A 5-star AC consumes significantly less electricity to provide the same amount of cooling compared to lower-rated models.\n\n2.  **Maintaining 24°C:** The BEE recommends 24°C as the ideal temperature for balancing comfort and energy efficiency in India. Setting the thermostat higher reduces the energy consumption of the air conditioner, as the compressor does not have to work as hard or as long. Every degree increase in the AC's temperature setting can save about 6% on energy consumption.\n\nSince most electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels, a reduction in electricity consumption directly leads to a reduction in associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Therefore, by using highly efficient ACs at an optimal temperature, the office building reduced its overall energy use and, consequently, its carbon footprint.",
    "reasoning": "The environmental benefit is a direct result of two factors: the use of BEE 5-star rated air conditioners and maintaining the temperature at 24°C.",
