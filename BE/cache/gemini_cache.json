    "raw": "Answer: B\nConfidence: 10\nReasoning: The Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality of stored commodities. A primary function of the WDRA is to promote the scientific warehousing of goods. The authority has notified 123 agricultural commodities for which Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) can be issued, based on quality standards set by Agmark or other approved grading agencies. Furthermore, the electronic NWRs (e-NWRs) issued by WDRA-registered warehouses assure banks of the quality and existence of the deposited agricultural commodities, which is essential for securing loans against them. This system encourages enhanced rewards for grading and quality. Therefore, the statement that the WDRA has no role in maintaining quality standards is incorrect.",
